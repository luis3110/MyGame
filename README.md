MountainBike Rampage

Create an infinite running game with an Mountainbiker as figure, a countdown of 90 seconds and coins to get points and extend the game time according to the points. High coins give 10 more seconds and low coins give 5 more seconds. Goal is it to keep the game running as long as possible.
